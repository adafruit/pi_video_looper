# video_looper.ini
# Main configuration file for video_looper.
# The video_looper works right out of the box by playing any video files that
# are in the root directory of an attached USB drive.
# In this file you can change a lot of the video_looper's behavior, like what
# video player is used or where it looks for media files.  
# Lines that begin with # are comments that will be ignored.
# Uncomment (=activate) a line by removing its preceding # character.
# Use ./reload.sh to restart the video_looper with any changed settings.

# Video_looper configuration block follows.
[video_looper]

# Set which video player will be used to play media files.  Can be either omxplayer,
# hello_video or image_player. omxplayer can play common formats like avi, mov, mp4, etc. and
# with full audio and video, but it has a small ~100ms delay between videos.
# If there is only one video omxplayer can also loop seamlessly.
# hello_video is a simpler player that doesn't do audio and only plays raw H264
# streams, but loops videos seamlessly if one video is played more than once.
# The image_player only displays images and for the duration configured in this file under the "image_player" section.
# The default is omxplayer.

# File Reader Location
# Where to find media files.  Can be usb_drive, directory or usb_drive_copymode.  
# When using usb_drive any USB stick inserted in to the Pi will be automatically 
# mounted and searched for media files (only in the root directory).  
# Alternatively the directory option will search only a specified directory on the SD 
# card for media files.  
# You can change the directory to be used in the [directory] section below.  
# The default is usb_drive.

# Note on usb_drive_copymode:
# If you enable this mode, media files are copied from the USB stick to the path 
# specified in the [directory] section below.
# see additional settings for copy-mode in the [copymode] section

# On Screen Display (OSD)

# when using a self looping player like hello_video wait_time is not waited between each repeat of one video but between different videos
# with omxplayer wait_time will also happen between every repeat of a video
wait_time = 0

# This option enables the display of the current date/time while waiting between the videos
# Please note that the RPi is not good at keeping the time so you need to setup NTP time sync or install a RTC module

# The below datetime_display can be on two lines if required. The top line is much bigger than the bottom line and suits the time better. The bottom line is more suited to the date. 'Thursday 13th February 2023' for example.
# If the bottom line not required just leave bottom_datetime_display_format empty.
# If the suffix is required after the day then %d{SUFFIX} should be put in the *_datetime_display_format.
# Some different examples of time and date are shown below with an example. (Only one pair of *_datetime_display_format should be without #)

# bgimage = /home/pi/loader.png

[control]
# In this section all settings to interact with the looper are defined

# Control the program via keyboard
# See the readme for the complete list of keyboard commands.

# This setting defines which Raspberry Pi GPIO pin (BOARD numbering!) will jump to which file in the playlist (first file has index 0)
# See: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html for info about the pin numbers
# the pins are pulled high so you need to connect your switch to the selected pin and Ground (e.g. pin 9) - there is some debouncing done in software
# The accepted settings are like this: "pinnumber" : videoindex or "pinnumber" : "filename" or "pinnumber" : "-1" or "pinnumber" : "+1"
# its also possible to send "keyboard commands" like shutdown or pause (see readme for available keyboard commands)
# the format follows the pygame key list (https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html) see example below. "keyboard_control" needs to be enabled for this to work
# to enable GPIO set a gpio_pin_map like in the example below
gpio_pin_map = 
#gpio_pin_map = "11" : 1, "13": 4, "15": "test.mp4", "16": "+2", "18": "-1", "19": "K_SPACE", "21": "K_p"
# Example - Pin 11 should start 2nd video in the playlist, Pin 13 should start 5th video, pin 15 should play file with name "test.mp4",
# pin 16 should jump 2 videos ahead and pin 18 should jump one video back
# pin 19 sends the "spacebar" to the looper, pausing the current video
# pin 21 sends the "p" key and thus triggers the shutdown of the Raspberry Pi


# USB drive file reader configuration follows.

# (see the file_reader section above to enable it)
# the default setting "replace" deletes any files in the video directory and then copies the files from the USB drive
# You can decide if new files on the drive should replace existing files or get added. "Replace" means that any existing videofiles on the RPi get deleted, and only the new files remain.
# This setting can be overruled by placing a file named "replace" or "add" on the drive.
# The default mode is "replace".
# NOTE: files with the same name are always overwritten

# with this setting you can control if a file named "loader.png" should be copied from the drive to be used eg as a background
# the file is copied to /home/pi/loader.png

# this setting defines a "password" that has to exist as a file (with the password as a filename) (extension does not matter)
# on the USB drive for the videolooper to accept videos from the USB drive
# default is videopi - you should consider changing it - 
# if it is empty no check will be performed
# for maximum compatibility use only ascii characters

[playlist]
# This setting allows for a fixed playlist. See the example.m3u file in assets for the syntax.

# hdmi the video sound will be played on the HDMI output, and when set to local

# sound through ALSA, using the device specified in the [alsa] section above.
# The both value is the default.

# Specify a sound volume output for the video player.

# video files. If the file does not exist, a default volume of 0db will be used.
# To use this feature create a file in the same directory as the videos and name
# it the value defined below (like 'sound_volume' by default), then inside the
# file add a single line with the volume value in text to pass to omxplayer (using
# its --vol option which takes a value in millibels).
# NOTE: This may introduce audible quantization error. Using hw_vol_file will
# generally give better sound quality.
