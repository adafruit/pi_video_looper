# video_looper.ini
# Main configuration file for video_looper.
# The video_looper works right out of the box by playing any video files that
# are in the root directory of an attached USB drive.
# In this file you can change a lot of the video_looper's behavior, like what
# video player is used or where it looks for media files.  
# Lines that begin with # are comments that will be ignored.
# Uncomment (=activate) a line by removing its preceding # character.
# Use ./reload.sh to restart the video_looper with any changed settings.

# Video_looper configuration block follows.
[video_looper]

# Set which video player will be used to play media files.  Can be either omxplayer,
# hello_video or image_player. omxplayer can play common formats like avi, mov, mp4, etc. and
# with full audio and video, but it has a small ~100ms delay between videos.
# If there is only one video omxplayer can also loop seamlessly.
# hello_video is a simpler player that doesn't do audio and only plays raw H264
# streams, but loops videos seamlessly if one video is played more than once.
# The image_player only displays images and for the duration configured in this file under the "image_player" section.
# The default is omxplayer.

# Where to find media files.  Can be usb_drive, directory or usb_drive_copymode.  
# When using usb_drive any USB stick inserted in to the Pi will be automatically 
# mounted and searched for media files (only in the root directory).  
# Alternatively the directory option will search only a specified directory on the SD 
# card for media files.

# The default is usb_drive.

# specified in the [directory] section below.
# see additional settings for copy-mode in the [copymode] section

# On Screen Display (OSD)

# If the bottom line not required just leave bottom_datetime_display_format empty.
# If the suffix is required after the day then %d{SUFFIX} should be put in the *_datetime_display_format.
# Some different examples of time and date are shown below with an example. (Only one pair of *_datetime_display_format should be without #)

# the pins are pulled high so you need to connect your switch to the selected pin and Ground (e.g. pin 9) - there is some debouncing done in software
# The accepted settings are like this: "pinnumber" : videoindex or "pinnumber" : "filename" or "pinnumber" : "-1" or "pinnumber" : "+1"
# its also possible to send "keyboard commands" like shutdown or pause (see readme for available keyboard commands)
# the format follows the pygame key list (https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html) see example below. "keyboard_control" needs to be enabled for this to work

# Example:
# Pin 11 starts the 2nd video in the playlist, 
# pin 13 starts the 5th video, 
# pin 16 jumps 2 videos ahead,
# pin 18 jumps one video back,
# pin 15 plays a file with name "video.mp4" (if it exists),
# pin 19 sends the "spacebar" to the looper, pausing the current video
# pin 21 sends the "p" key and thus triggers the shutdown of the Raspberry Pi

# it the value defined below (like 'sound_volume' by default), then inside the
# file add a single line with the volume value in text to pass to omxplayer (using
